Summary:
In summary the data does show it is a popular option in New York to get to your destination.  I would recommend additional research into data specific to Des Moines Iowa.  For example, look into detail of the demographics and are the streets friendly to commuting by bike?  I suspect NY is quite different then Des Moines.
